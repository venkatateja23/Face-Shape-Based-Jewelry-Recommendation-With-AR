# Face-Shape-Based-Jewelry-Recommendation-With-AR
This project implements a face shape detection and jewelry recommendation system using Python. Faces are detected using Haar Cascade classifiers, and facial landmarks are extracted using Dlib’s 68-point landmark predictor. Geometric analysis of facial features along with K-Means clustering on the forehead region is used to classify face shapes such as round, square, oval, and rectangular.

Based on the detected face shape, suitable jewelry is recommended using predefined fashion rules. Additionally, the system supports virtual jewelry try-on using Augmented Reality (AR), allowing users to visualize earrings and accessories on their face in real time.
